This is a fun project I made for learning. It's a GUI tool which provides you following modes to click screenshot - 

<ul>
<li>Crop tabs of browser
<li>Crop taskbar
<li>Both
<li>Normal Screenshot
</ul>

Disclaimer : I made it to learning purposes so it is most likely not going to work in your system. If you want to use it, I made a Command line tool which is simpler and after some edits you can use it for your own system.

I saved image of windows Icon and minimize, maximize, and close buttons. Pyautogui finds these images, take cordinates and creates a cropped screenshot.
GUI is made by PyQt6.
